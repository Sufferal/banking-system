# Banking System
My attempt at implementing a banking system using SOLID principles and design patterns in Java.

## Usage
1. Download Intellij
2. Clone the repository
3. Open the project in intellij
4. Run the main method in `src/Main.java`

## Principles and Patterns Used
### SOLID
A set of five object-oriented design principles intended to make software designs more maintainable, flexible, and easy to understand. The acronym stands for Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle. Each principle addresses a specific aspect of software design, such as the organization of responsibilities, the handling of dependencies, and the design of interfaces. By following these principles, software developers can create more modular, testable, and reusable code that is easier to modify and extend over time. These principles are widely accepted and adopted in the software development community and can be applied to any object-oriented programming language.

### Creational Design Patterns
A category of design patterns that focus on the process of object creation. They provide a way to create objects in a flexible and controlled manner, while decoupling the client code from the specifics of object creation. Creational design patterns address common problems encountered in object creation, such as how to create objects with different initialization parameters, how to create objects based on certain conditions, or how to ensure that only a single instance of an object is created. 
I used the following creational design patterns in this project:
* Singleton
* Factory Method
* Builder
* Prototype
