# Banking System
My attempt at implementing a banking system using SOLID principles and design patterns in Java.

## Usage
1. Download Intellij
2. Clone the repository
3. Open the project in intellij
4. Run the main method in `src/Main.java`

## Theory
### SOLID
A set of five object-oriented design principles intended to make software designs more maintainable, flexible, and easy to understand. The acronym stands for Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle. Each principle addresses a specific aspect of software design, such as the organization of responsibilities, the handling of dependencies, and the design of interfaces. By following these principles, software developers can create more modular, testable, and reusable code that is easier to modify and extend over time. These principles are widely accepted and adopted in the software development community and can be applied to any object-oriented programming language.
