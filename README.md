# Banking System
My attempt at implementing a banking system using SOLID principles and design patterns in Java.

## Usage
1. Download Intellij
2. Clone the repository
3. Open the project in intellij
4. Run the main method in `src/Main.java`

## Principles and Patterns Used
### SOLID
A set of five object-oriented design principles intended to make software designs more maintainable, flexible, and easy to understand. The acronym stands for Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle. Each principle addresses a specific aspect of software design, such as the organization of responsibilities, the handling of dependencies, and the design of interfaces. By following these principles, software developers can create more modular, testable, and reusable code that is easier to modify and extend over time. These principles are widely accepted and adopted in the software development community and can be applied to any object-oriented programming language.

### Creational Design Patterns
A category of design patterns that focus on the process of object creation. They provide a way to create objects in a flexible and controlled manner, while decoupling the client code from the specifics of object creation. Creational design patterns address common problems encountered in object creation, such as how to create objects with different initialization parameters, how to create objects based on certain conditions, or how to ensure that only a single instance of an object is created. 

I used the following creational design patterns in this project:
* Singleton
* Factory Method
* Builder
* Prototype

### Structural Design Patterns
A category of design patterns that focus on the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures and systems. They provide a way to organize objects and classes in a way that is both flexible and efficient, while allowing for the reuse and modification of existing code. Structural design patterns address common problems encountered in the composition of classes and objects, such as how to create new objects that inherit functionality from existing objects, how to create objects that share functionality without duplicating code, or how to define relationships between objects in a flexible and extensible way.

I used the following structural design patterns in this project:
* Facade
* Adapter
* Decorator
* Proxy

### Behavioral Design Patterns
A category of design patterns that focus on the interaction and communication between objects and classes. They provide a way to organize the behavior of objects in a way that is both flexible and reusable, while separating the responsibilities of objects from the specific implementation details. Behavioral design patterns address common problems encountered in object behavior, such as how to define interactions between objects, how to control the flow of messages between objects, or how to define algorithms and policies that can be reused across different objects and classes.

I used the following behavioral design patterns in this project:
* Iterator
* Strategy
* Observer
